**AI-powered collaborative filmmaking**

OpenMontage is a platform for creating films through community collaboration, inspired by the open-source movement. In the age of AI video generation, anyone can contribute video segments — no expensive equipment, no film crew required. Just as developers contribute code to open-source projects, creators can now contribute AI-generated video segments to collaborative films.

## Vision

**AI democratizes filmmaking.** With tools like Runway, Sora, and others, anyone can generate high-quality video from text prompts. OpenMontage harnesses this power at scale: contributors create segments using AI, the community votes on the best versions, and a complete film emerges through collective creativity.

## How It Works

1. **Script Foundation** — A screenplay is broken down into multiple segments
2. **AI-Powered Contribution** — Anyone can generate video clips for each segment using AI tools (Runway, Sora, Pika, etc.)
3. **Community Voting** — The community votes on different AI-generated versions of each segment
4. **Dynamic Assembly** — A viewer app streams the highest-rated segments in real-time to create the complete film
5. **Continuous Evolution** — As more AI-generated contributions arrive, the film keeps improving

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds — video segments, scripts, tooling, and ideas. See our documentation for more details.
